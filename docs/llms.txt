# ukc19

A selection of aggregated COVID-19 data from the UK, in an easy to use
form for teaching and demonstration purposes.

This data is sourced from publicly available data sets from various UK
government websites where different aspects of the UK COVID-19 response
published data. It is by no means comprehensive but aims to capture some
of the main data so that it is preserved.

At present the data is mostly focused on England.
